> ### [Blazor Server and Blazor Webassembly] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo Server](https://blazorserverrealworld.azurewebsites.net)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Demo Webassembly](https://blazorrealworldwasm.z6.web.core.windows.net/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with Blazor server and Blazor webassembly including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the Blazor community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

> The app consists of two programs:  blazor server and blazor wasm that you can run. They use the same pages defined in SharedLib and the same application and infrastructure libraries

# Getting started

Clone the repo and run one of the clients with Visual Studio (Windows / Mac / Code). Please ensure .net core v3.1 or higher is installed
